# Cyber4s 3rd Pre-Course Final Project
# name: `Dayan Badalbaev`.

I have done this project with one main goal, to improve my skills as programmer, and i surely can say- I acomplished this goal.
In `index.js` there is a class (self learning).
this class manages the all storage.
it has #tasks- private property witch holds the information.
  and  myStorage- holds the local storage.

the initialization of the DOM was preformed by the function syncDOM().
the event listeners are all outside the class.

I hope you will appreciate the learning and investment I have made!.
